# Technical Specification for "Unit Circle Explorer" Streamlit Application

This document provides the detailed technical specifications for developing a one-page Streamlit application titled "Unit Circle Explorer." The app is designed to enhance the understanding of the unit circle and its relationship with angles and trigonometric functions.

## Overview

The "Unit Circle Explorer" is an educational tool designed to display and interact with trigonometric concepts using visual and interactive elements. Here, users can explore angles, the corresponding points on the unit circle, and visualize trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent.

## Application Features

### Interactive Angle Selection

- **Slider and Input Box**:  
  Users will be able to select an angle using a slider for a continuous experience or enter a specific angle manually using a text input box. The app should support angles in both degrees and radians.
  
- **Dynamic Update**:  
  As the user changes the angle through the slider or textbox, all visualizations and outputs will automatically update to reflect these changes.

### Unit Circle Visualization

- **Circle Display**:  
  Render a unit circle using a Python plotting library (e.g., Matplotlib or Plotly) within the Streamlit app.
  
- **Angle and Point Highlighting**:  
  Display the selected angle on the circle and mark the corresponding point with coordinates (cos(θ), sin(θ)).

- **Real-Time Feedback**:  
  As the user adjusts the angle, the circle visualization will update in real-time to reflect these changes.

### Trigonometric Function Display

- **Function Values**:  
  Display the values of sin(θ), cos(θ), and tan(θ) in a visually accessible manner. These will be shown as annotations on the circle and as part of a dynamic table within the app.
  
- **Dynamic Table**:  
  Create a table to showcase the numerical values of sin(θ), cos(θ), and tan(θ) that adjust with user inputs.

## Visualization Details

### Interactive Charts

- **Dynamic Line Charts**:  
  To visualize trends and relationships between the angles and trigonometric function values.
  
- **Bar Graphs and Scatter Plots**:  
  To demonstrate additional insights such as the periodicity and correlation between different trigonometric function values at various angles.

### Annotations & Tooltips

- **Annotations**:  
  Provide detailed insights next to visualization elements, like marking significant angles (0, π/2, π, 3π/2, and 2π).
  
- **Tooltips**:  
  Offer explanatory tooltips that provide additional explanations or mathematical context when users hover over specific visualization elements.

## Additional Details

### User Interaction

- **Input Forms and Widgets**:  
  Facilitate exploration through widgets (sliders, text inputs) that allow users to adjust parameters and view real-time changes in the unit circle and function displays.

- **Real-Time Updates**:  
  Ensure all visual elements respond instantly to user input, providing an interactive learning experience.

### Documentation

- **Inline Help**:  
  Include context-sensitive help and tooltips that guide users through using the application effectively, explaining each view or control.

- **Guidance Through Process**:  
  Ensure users can easily follow the steps involved in data exploration and interpretation of the unit circle concept.

### Learning Outcomes and Reference

This interactive tool aligns with educational goals by helping users to:

- Gain a clearer understanding of the key insights derived from exploring angles and their trigonometric relationships.
- Transform raw trigonometric data into interactive visualizations using Streamlit, promoting engagement and comprehension.
- Understand the data preprocessing and exploration process, as well as visualization techniques within a controlled environment.

### Related Reference

The application directly supports learnings from Section 4.3 of the user's material, facilitating the understanding of the **unit circle** and how it defines the relation of angles with trigonometric functions visually. The reference helps solidify comprehension of circular functions and their periodic nature, providing a practical approach to applying theoretical knowledge.
