# Unit Circle Explorer

## Overview
The **Unit Circle Explorer** is an educational Streamlit application designed to aid the understanding of the unit circle and its relationship with angles and trigonometric functions. Users can interactively explore trigonometric concepts, visualize sine, cosine, and tangent values, and understand the unit circle better through engaging visualizations.

## Features
- **Interactive Angle Selection**: Adjust angles using a slider or input box supporting both degrees and radians.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Visualizations and outputs update in real-time based on user input.
- **Unit Circle Visualization**: A clear rendering of the unit circle highlighting the angle and corresponding coordinates.
- **Trigonometric Function Display**: Values for sin(θ), cos(θ), and tan(θ) are displayed dynamically.
- **User Guidance**: Tooltips and explanations to enhance understanding.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12
- Streamlit
- Plotly
- NumPy
