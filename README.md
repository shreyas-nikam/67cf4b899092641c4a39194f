# Unit Circle Explorer Streamlit Application

## Overview
The Unit Circle Explorer is an educational tool designed to visualize and interact with trigonometric concepts including the unit circle and the corresponding sine, cosine, and tangent functions.

## Features
- **Unit Circle Visualization**: Users can explore the unit circle by selecting angles through a slider or text input. The circle visual updates dynamically to reflect the chosen angle.
- **Trigonometric Functions Explorer**: Users can visualize sine, cosine, and tangent functions in relation to the selected angle, with real-time updates of their values.
- **Interactive Components**: The application offers a user-friendly interface where users can select angles and immediately see the effects on the unit circle and trigonometric graphs.
